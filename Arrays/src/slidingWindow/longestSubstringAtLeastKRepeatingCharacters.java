    Problem Statement:

        - Given a string 's' and an integer 'k', return the length of the longest substring of 's' such that the
          frequency of each character in this substring is greater than or equal to 'k'.

        - NOTE: If no such substring exists, return 0.

        - Sample Input: s = "ababbc", k = 2; Output = 5 ("ababb")

    General Observations:

        - The problem involves finding the longest substring of 's' where every character appears at least k times.

        - Brute Force Approach:

            -
