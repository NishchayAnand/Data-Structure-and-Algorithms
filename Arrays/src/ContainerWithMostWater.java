/* Problem Statement: Given an array "height" containing n integers, each representing wall heights. Find 
 * 					  two walls that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container 
 * 					  contains the most water.
 * 
 * General Observations:
 * 
 * 	- The amount of water held in a container made up of two walls = (Distance between two walls) x
 * 	  (Distance between the x-axis and the height of the container, i.e., the minimum height of the two
 *    walls).
 * 
 * 	- Brute Force Approach:
 * 
 * 		- Use a nested loop {i, j} to check every pair of walls and calculate the area of water they 
 * 		  could hold.
 * 
 * 		- Time Complexity: O(n^2).
 * 
 * 		- Space Complexity: O(1).
 * 
 * 	- 
 * 
 * 	- Two Pointers Approach:
 * 
 * 		-
