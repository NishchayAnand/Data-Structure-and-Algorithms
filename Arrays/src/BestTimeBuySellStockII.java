    Problem Statement:

        - Given an integer array 'prices' where prices[i] represent the price of a given stock on the ith day, return
          the maximum profit one can achieve if multi transactions are allowed.

        - NOTE: You cannot start another transaction in case you already have an ongoing transaction. In simple terms,
                we must sell before buying again.

        - For example, prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4] -> output = 7 (Buy at 1, Sell at 5; Buy at 3, Sell at 6)

    General Observations:

        - Basic Intuition:
            - Explore all possible combinations of profitable transactions and find the combination which returns the
              highest total profit.
