    Problem Statement: Given two integer arrays 'preorder' and 'inorder' where 'preorder' is the preorder traversal of
                       a binary tree and 'inorder' is the inorder traversal of the same tree, construct and return the
                       binary tree.

    General Observations:

        - The first element in the 'preorder' list represents the 'root' of the tree.

        - All the elements to the left of the 'root' in the 'inorder' list belongs to the left subtree of the root.
          Similarly, all the elements to the right of the 'root' in the 'inorder' list belongs to the right subtree of
          the root.
