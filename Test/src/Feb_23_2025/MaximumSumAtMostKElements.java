    Problem Statement:

        - You are given a 2D integer matrix of size n x m, an integer array 'limits' of length n, and an integer k.

        - Find the maximum sum of at most k elements from the matrix such that the number of elements taken from the
          ith row of grid does not exceed limits[i].

    General Observations:

        - The problem involves "selecting at most k elements from an n Ã— m matrix while respecting row limits" and
          maximizing the sum.
