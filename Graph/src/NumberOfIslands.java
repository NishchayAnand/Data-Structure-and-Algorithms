	Problem Statement: Given a 2D grid of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of islands.

					   NOTE:
					   		- An island is a group of adjacent lands connected either horizontally or vertically (not diagonally).
					   		- The grid's boundaries are surrounded by water.

 	General Observations:

 		- Consider the given 2D grid to be a graph where each cell containing '1' represent a graph vertex.

 		- An edge (undirected) exists between two vertices if they are adjacent cells containing '1'.

 		- Each connected component of '1's in the graph corresponds to an island.

		- Primary Problem: Find all connected components in the given connected undirected graph (represented as an
		                   adjacency matrix).

		- Intuition:
			- Loop through the grid. For each cell containing '1' that hasnâ€™t been visited, treat it as the starting
			  point for a graph traversal (DFS or BFS).

		- GCC Algorithm:
			- count = 0;
			- for each row_index in grid:
				- for each column_index in grid:
					- if graph[row_index][column_index] == '1' and visited[row_index][column_index] == false:
						- count = count + 1;
						// Mark all cells (vertices) connected to current cell (vertex) as visited
						- DFS(graph, row_index, column_index, visited);

		- DFS Algorithm:

			- Hypotheses:
				- F(graph, row_index, column_index, visited) will traverse all the direct / indirect neighbours
						  of vertex = [row_index, column_index] and mark them as visited.

			- Recursive Steps:

				// Step 1: Process the current vertex
				visited[row_index][column_index] = true;

				// Step 2: Visit all the unvisited neighbours of the current vertex
				- F(graph, row_index, column_index-1, visited); // Left
				- F(graph, row_index-1, column_index, visited); // Top
				- F(graph, row_index, column_index+1, visited); // Right
				- F(graph, row_index+1, column_index, visited); // Down

			- Base Conditions:

				- isInvalidCell = (column_index < 0) or (column_index >= n) or (row_index < 0) or (row_index >= m);
				- isInvalidVertex = graph[row_index][column_index] == '0';

				- if isInvalidCell or isInvalidVertex or visited[row_index][column_index]:
				     - return; // do nothing if the vertex does not exist or is already visited

		- Time Complexity Analysis:

			- In worst-case scenario, all cells will be visited twice (grid containing all '1's). Hence, time
			  complexity = O(m*n).

		- Space Complexity Analysis:

			- Maintaining a 2D array of size m x n to keep account of the visited vertices. Hence, space complexity = O(m*n).
