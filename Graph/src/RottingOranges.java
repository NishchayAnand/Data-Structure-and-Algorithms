/* Problem Statement: 
 * 
 * 	- You are given an m x n grid where each cell can have one of three values:
 * 
 * 		- 0 representing an empty cell,
 * 		- 1 representing a fresh orange, or
 * 		- 2 representing a rotten orange.
 * 
 * 	- Every minute, any fresh orange that is 4-directionally adjacent to a rotten orange becomes rotten.
 * 
 * 	- Return the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange. If this is 
 * 	  impossible, return -1.
 * 
 * General Observations:
 * 
 * 	- All fresh oranges 4-directionally adjacent to "each rotten orange" get rotten simultaneously in the 
 *    next 1 minute. 
 *
