/*

    Problem Statement:

        - Given two integer arrays 'nums1' and 'nums2', return the maximum length of a subarray that appears in both arrays.

        - Sample Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,2,1], nums2 = [3,2,1,4,7]; Output: 3 ([3,2,1])

    General Observations:

        Q. What do you understand by the problem statement?
        A. The problem involves finding the longest common subarray in 'nums' and 'nums2'.

    Brute Force Approach: What is the simplest way to solve this problem?

        - Iterate over every possible subarray in 'nums1' and check if it exists in 'nums2'.

        - Algorithm: Can you describe how this would work?
            -

        - Time Complexity: O(n^2 * m^2).

        - Space Complexity: O(1).

    Sliding Window Approach: Can we improve this by utilizing some pattern in the problem?
